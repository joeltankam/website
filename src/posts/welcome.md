# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my new blog! This is built using Vue.js and TailwindCSS, with markdown support for easy content creation.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in markdown
- **Social Media Sharing**: Share posts on various platforms
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS
- **Fast Performance**: Powered by Vite

## Getting Started

Creating new blog posts is as simple as adding markdown files to the posts directory. Each post should include frontmatter with metadata like title, date, and tags.

```javascript
// Example code block
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Thanks for visiting!
